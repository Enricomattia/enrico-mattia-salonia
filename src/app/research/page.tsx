        <CardExtended title="Identifying Belief-dependent Preferences">
          <Abstract content="Why do investors avoid information or trade excessively due to overconfidence? Why do subjects in dictator games deliberately remain uninformed about the efficiency of their transfer? Possibly because their well-being is directly influenced by their beliefs, i.e., they have belief-dependent preferences. However, existing theories of belief-dependent preferences fail to generate testable predictions; in particular, identification of beliefs and preferences is not possible. This paper addresses this issue by providing an axiomatic characterization of a class of preferences and belief-updating rules that deviate from Bayesian updating. Preferences, beliefs and updating rules are identified from choices over contingent menus, each of which entails a set of menus of acts available at a later time contingent on an uncertain state of the world. The result provide a theory-based approach to experimental designs aiming at testing information avoidance and other behaviors consistent with belief-dependent preferences."

          <Abstract
            content="Revealed preference theory equates choices with preferences over the consequences the choice induces. Nevertheless, if a decision criterion prescribes an act for reasons unrelated to its consequences, the inference drawn regarding preferences is misleading. I study the behaviour of non-consequentialist individuals who have preferences for universalisation. They choose the action that, in a counterfactual scenario in which it is chosen by everyone else as well, leads to their preferred consequences. I develop a model for individuals who value their choices in light of a counterfactual consequence these induce. Choice is interpreted as revealing a preference for counterfactual consequences. I impose axioms to single out the most prominent models of universalisation, compare them, highlight and arguably overcome their limitations. I propose a unifying model of universalisation inspired by the equal sacrifice principle."

          title="Can Pessimistic Beliefs Threaten Redistribution?"
          authors="Michele Bisceglia"

        >
          <Abstract content="We develop and test a theory of how beliefs about other people's responsiveness to incentives shape preferences for redistribution. In a linear income taxation model where agents have heterogeneous prosocial preferences, more altruistic agents distort their labour supply to a lesser extent when the tax rate is higher. If agents have imperfect information on (the distribution of) preferences in the society, overly pessimistic beliefs imply a relatively low Condorcet-winner tax, even though most agents are poor and/or altruist. We develop an experimental design to test this prediction."

        <CardExtended title="Welfarist Meritocracy">
          <Abstract
            content="I develop a framework to conceptualise different understandings of meritocracy. A meritocracy is characterised by a metric of merit and a related reward system. Individuals obtain a higher reward when they score higher on the metric of merit. I focus on a strictly welfarist understanding of these two elements. An individual's action scores higher in the metric of merit than another if it leads to a pareto improvement in welfare. The reward for merit is individual welfare. I show that, under these two assumptions, for any collective action profile, there is a meritocratic reward system implementing it. I thus argue that meritocracy is a vacuous allocation rule when conceptualised through a purely welfarist lens. As a result, I propose that meritocracy should be viewed as a fundamentally non welfarist criterion."
